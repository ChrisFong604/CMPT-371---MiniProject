**Your Transport Protocol**

Step Two (12 points):

TCP is the reliable transport protocol of the Internet. You will study and observe the TCP protocol behaviour in IS(4). In this step of your project, we want you to implement your own flavor of connection-oriented, reliable, pipelined transport layer protocol which includes flow control and congestion control mechanisms as well. To do this, you need to specify your mechanisms, and decide your socket type (2 points). On the chosen socket, you then define and implement your own transport layer protocol. (10 points)

Step Three (3 points):

In this step of the project, you need to analyze the traffic of your transport protocol using wireshark. Through this traffic analysis, you need to prove that your protocol is connection-oriented, has acceptable performance, and implements flow control and congestion control mechanisms.

Step Four (5 points):

Test your protocol with other traffic (4 points). You can choose to use network simulators, run your protocol across the network, or bring up your virtual nodes to test. Is your protocol fair? Can you prove? (1 point)

Deliverables
For steps Two to four, please make a zip file including:

- Your code (.py)
- Your capture and analysis (e.g., figure) files
- A .pdf file including specification of your protocol, your test procedures, and explanation of your results showing the desired working of your protocol

and submit it to this activity in Canvas. One submission will be enough for each group (should automatically show for both group members).
